def integrate(fun, x1, x2, intervals=1):
    """Compute the integral of fun from x1 to x2 using Simpson's rule.

    Arguments:
        fun - a function with one real argument that returns a real value.
        x1  - starting value of interval for integration (left endpoint)
        x2  - ending value for interval for integration (right endpoint)
        intervals - number of sub-intervals to use with Simpson's rule.
              Default is 1 sub-interval.
    Returns:
        (float) numerical approximation to the integral of fun from x1 to x2.

    Example:
    >>> def fun(x): return x+2
    >>> integrate(fun, 0, 1)
    2.5
